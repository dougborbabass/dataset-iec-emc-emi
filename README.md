# dataset-iec-emc-emi

Repository created as part of the objectives of the Dissertation presented as a requirement for obtaining a Master's degree by the Graduate Program in Electrical Engineering of the Polytechnic School of the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul.

### The standards met in this repository are:
- IEC 61000-4-2
- IEC 61000-4-4
- IEC 61000-4-5
- IEC 61000-4-29

### To run the project and generate the dataset with the waveforms:
- open and run the file:

```
gera_formas_de_onda.m
```

### Functions for each waveform
- gerarDips.m
- gerarDischarge.m
- gerarSourge.m
- gerarTransient.m

When executing the project, it generates a csv file containing the voltage and current values ​​for the waveforms cited by the highlighted standards.
